> ### TL;DR – Evolution of Wi-Fi Security:
>
> 1. **WEP** was the first Wi-Fi security protocol but was quickly broken due to weak encryption and IV reuse.  
> 2. **WPA** introduced TKIP and better key management but still relied on the insecure RC4 cipher.  
> 3. **WPA2** replaced TKIP with AES (CCMP), vastly improving encryption strength—though WPA2-PSK remained vulnerable to offline attacks.  
> 4. **WPA3** uses **SAE** for stronger, password-authenticated key exchange with forward secrecy and dictionary attack resistance.  
> 5. **Transition mode** helps with WPA3 adoption but introduces downgrade risks—separate SSIDs or disabling it is recommended once all clients support WPA3.

Wi-Fi has become an integral part of modern networking, but its security has evolved significantly over time. From the flawed early implementations of WEP to the robust protections offered by WPA3, this article outlines the journey of Wi-Fi security protocols and highlights key improvements at each stage.

## WEP – Wired Equivalent Privacy

Introduced in 1997 with the original IEEE 802.11 standard, WEP was designed to provide a level of privacy comparable to wired networks. It used the RC4 stream cipher and a 40-bit or 104-bit key along with a 24-bit Initialization Vector (IV).

### Why WEP Failed:

- IVs were reused due to their small size (24 bits), enabling key recovery attacks.
- Weak key scheduling in RC4 allowed for statistical attacks (e.g., Fluhrer, Mantin, and Shamir attack).
- Authentication could be spoofed.
- Cracking tools like Aircrack-ng made WEP trivial to break within minutes.

WEP was officially deprecated by the Wi-Fi Alliance in 2004 but remains a cautionary example of poor cryptographic design.

## WPA – Wi-Fi Protected Access

As a stopgap measure, WPA was introduced in 2003 before the full ratification of WPA2.

### Key Features:

- Still used RC4 but introduced TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol).
- Per-packet key mixing and integrity checks (MIC – Message Integrity Code).
- Replay protection and extended IVs.

### Shortcomings:

- RC4 was still used and remained a security concern.
- Designed to be firmware-upgradable, so it was constrained by WEP-era hardware limitations.
- TKIP itself had vulnerabilities, including weaknesses in the MIC (Michael) algorithm.

WPA was a necessary transition but not a long-term solution.

## WPA2 – Robust Security Network (RSN)

Ratified in 2004, WPA2 became mandatory for Wi-Fi Certified devices in 2006.

### Key Improvements:

- Introduced CCMP (Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol), based on AES.
- Stronger encryption and integrity checking.
- Eliminated RC4 and replaced TKIP (although WPA2-TKIP remained for backward compatibility).
- Two authentication options:
  - **WPA2-PSK**: Pre-Shared Key, suitable for home use.
  - **WPA2-Enterprise**: Uses 802.1X and RADIUS servers for dynamic key exchange.

### Issues:

- WPA2-PSK still allowed offline dictionary attacks if the passphrase was weak.
- No forward secrecy—compromising the PSK or PMK allowed decryption of all previous traffic.
- Vulnerable to KRACK (Key Reinstallation Attack) due to flaws in the 4-way handshake.

Despite these issues, WPA2 remains widely used and reasonably secure when implemented properly.

## WPA3 – The Future of Wi-Fi Security

Released in 2018, WPA3 addresses many of WPA2’s shortcomings and reflects a modern security mindset.

### Enhancements:

- Replaces the PSK model with **SAE (Simultaneous Authentication of Equals)** for WPA3-Personal.
  - Password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE).
  - Resists offline dictionary attacks.
  - Provides forward secrecy.
- **WPA3-Enterprise** supports 192-bit security mode for high-security environments.
- Improves protection for weak passwords.
- Mandates Protected Management Frames (PMF), previously optional under WPA2.

### WPA3 Transition Mode:

To ease migration, WPA3 allows for a **transition mode** where WPA2 and WPA3 coexist on the same SSID. However, this introduces downgrade attack risks:

> **Best practice**: Use separate SSIDs for WPA2 and WPA3 if transition mode cannot be disabled.

## Summary

| Protocol | Cipher | Auth Method | Vulnerabilities |
|---------|--------|--------------|------------------|
| WEP     | RC4    | Shared/Open | Weak IVs, key recovery |
| WPA     | RC4+TKIP | PSK/802.1X | Weak MIC, legacy issues |
| WPA2    | AES-CCMP | PSK/802.1X | KRACK, offline attacks |
| WPA3    | AES-CCMP | SAE/802.1X | Downgrade risk (transition mode) |

## Recommendations

- **Avoid WEP and WPA** entirely.
- **Use WPA2-Enterprise** or **WPA3** wherever possible.
- Ensure **strong passphrases** and **enable PMF**.
- For WPA3 adoption, avoid transition mode when feasible or monitor for downgrade attacks.
- Periodically audit your wireless infrastructure for legacy clients and protocols.
