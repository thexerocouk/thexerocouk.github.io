**Reflecting on CHCon 2024: A Huge Thank You to All Attendees!**

Last week, I had the pleasure of running my **WiFi - Novice to Professional** practical WiFi penetration testing session at CHCon 2024. It was fantastic to meet so many of you in person, share my passion and to see how engaged everyone was with the material. I genuinely enjoyed the entire experience and above all, I hope you all learned something :) 

As a thank you for attending, I’d like to offer you the chance to continue building on what we covered in the session. For CHCon attendees, my **WiFi Attacks Specialist online course** is available for **just $97**—a big discount from the regular price.

This course goes further into everything we talked about during the session, with detailed tutorials, more tools, and in-depth exercises to sharpen your skills.

Just use  code **CHCON2024** at checkout. It's valid for the next two weeks, so don’t wait too long to grab it!

Visit [https://training.thexero.co.uk/p/wifi-specialist](https://training.thexero.co.uk/p/wifi-specialist) to enrol. If you have questions or want to share how you’re getting on, feel free to reach out—I’d love to hear from you.

Thanks again for making CHCon 2024 such a memorable event. I hope to see you online or at another event soon!

Cheers,  
Toby
