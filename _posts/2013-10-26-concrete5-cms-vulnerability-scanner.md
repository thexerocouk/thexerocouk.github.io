Over the last year, I have been performing penetrative application tests, and there is a huge variety of different CMS frameworks available to businesses. One of the frameworks I have been testing over the last 12 months has been the Concrete5 CMS system. There are not a great number of public vulnerabilities for this system yet, so I took it upon myself to write a blackbox vulnerability scanner for this CMS.

The scanner checks known version details about public vulnerabilities. Conscan can be found at the following link: <a href="https://github.com/nullsecuritynet/tools/raw/master/scanner/conscan/release/conscan-1.2.tgz" target="_blank">https://github.com/nullsecuritynet/tools/raw/master/scanner/conscan/release/conscan-1.2.tgz</a>
