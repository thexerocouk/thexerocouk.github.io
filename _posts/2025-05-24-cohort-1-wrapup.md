## Cohort 1 Wrap-Up: Thank You and What’s Next

We did it!

Our **first online cohort for the WiFi Attacks Specialist course** wrapped up earlier this month, and I couldn't be more thrilled with how it went. We had **12 engaged and passionate participants** who brought great energy, asked fantastic questions, and made it an incredibly rewarding experience.

The live, instructor-led training was just the beginning. All participants now have **full access to the course recording and materials**, which are available anytime via our training platform:

This includes:

- The full session recording  
- All supporting slides and resources  

It was an honour to teach such a sharp group of learners, and I’m already looking forward to what we’ll do in future cohorts.

If you missed out this time—don’t worry! We’re already planning the **next live training session**. Be sure to keep an eye on [training.thexero.co.uk](https://training.thexero.co.uk) or subscribe to the newsletter so you don’t miss out.

Thanks again to everyone who joined. Until next time—  
**Toby**
