After numerous requests and the incredible response to our live event last November, we are excited to announce the launch of our first-ever online cohort, happening on April 10!

This exclusive experience includes live, instructor-led training for our flagship WiFi Attacks Specialist course. Not only will you gain access to the full course content, but you will also have the opportunity to participate in a live question-and-answer session with me, where I will provide real-time insights and address your questions.

As a founding member of this cohort, you will receive lifetime access to all future course updates via our online training portal, along with a recording of the live session to revisit at your convenience.

Pre-sale is happening now, and early bird tickets are expected to go fast. Do not miss your chance to secure your spot and be part of this hands-on, practical learning experience.

Until then, happy hacking!
