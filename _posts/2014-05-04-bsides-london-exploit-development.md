BSides London 2014 last week was my first attempt at teaching an exploit development class a group of people which I had never met before. On the whole, the hands on 1 hour workshop I ran on Stack Based Buffer Overflows had a great turnout and all spaces were filled.

The workshop covered the basics of fuzzing and by the end of the 60 minutes, we had created a Remote Code Execution exploit after we immersed ourselves within the world of the computer memory to craft custom exploit code using a variety of different payloads.

The vulnerable application was the FreeFloat FTP server. The process and video is documented at the link below.
