<h4>Release Date</h4>
14 October 2013

<h4>Vendor</h4>
Sam Brishes – http://www.pytes.net/

<h4>Affected Product</h4>
Dexs PM System WordPress Plugin Version 1.0.1

<h4>Vulnerability Class</h4>
Persistent Cross-Site Scripting
<h4>Vulnerability Details</h4>
The Dexs PM System suffers from a persistent Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability when sending a message to another user.

<h4>Proof of Concept</h4>
The following text can be entered into the subject field when sending a message to another user.

    <script>alert('xss');</script>

When the receiving user opens the message, a JavaScript alert dialog box will appear containing the text ‘xss.’

<h4>Impact</h4>
If exploited, an attacker could then conduct request for attacks against the WordPress installation. Depending on the role of the victim user, this could allow for a compromise of CMS WordPress install itself.
