## Exciting News: Launch of Our First Online Cohort for WiFi Attacks Specialist!

After numerous requests and the incredible response to our live event last November, we are excited to announce the launch of our first-ever online cohort, happening on **April 10**!

This exclusive experience includes **live, instructor-led training** for our flagship **WiFi Attacks Specialist** course. Not only will you gain access to the full course content, but you will also have the opportunity to participate in a **live question-and-answer session** with me, where I will provide real-time insights and address your questions.

As a founding member of this cohort, you will receive **lifetime access** to all future course updates via our online training portal, along with a recording of the live session to revisit at your convenience.

**Pre-sale is happening now**, and early bird tickets are expected to go fast. Do not miss your chance to be part of something special and join this hands-on, practical learning experience.

Until then, happy hacking!
